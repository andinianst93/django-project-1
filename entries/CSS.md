# Introduction to CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology in web development. It plays a crucial role in determining how web pages look and feel. In this brief overview, we'll explore what CSS is and why it's essential.

## What is CSS?

CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of HTML and XML documents. It allows developers to define styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, for web elements. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), web designers can create visually appealing and responsive websites.

## How Does CSS Work?

CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. For example, you can use a selector to specify that all paragraph elements (`<p>`) should have a certain font size and color. CSS properties like `font-size`, `color`, and `margin` control the specific styling details.

## Cascading Style Sheets

The term "cascading" in CSS refers to its ability to handle conflicting styles by following a specific order of precedence. Styles can be defined at various levels, from inline styles within HTML tags to external CSS files. When multiple styles conflict, CSS determines which one takes precedence based on the cascade and specificity rules.

## Conclusion

In summary, CSS is a powerful tool for web developers to control the appearance of web pages. It enables the separation of content and presentation, making websites more maintainable and visually appealing. Understanding how CSS works and its cascading nature is essential for creating effective and responsive web designs.
